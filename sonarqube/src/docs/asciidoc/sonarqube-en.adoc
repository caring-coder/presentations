== Program Analysis

=== Dynamic
[%step]
* tests (automated or not)
* fuzzer
* profiler
* sampling profiler
* taint analysis
* debugging

[.notes]
****
Fuzzer -> random input testing a range of values

Exact profiler -> slow down execution

Sampling profiler -> regular snap of stack states

Latency profiler -> l'attente pendant les interactions avec GUI

Taint analysis -> watch how data propagate in one or more system

---

Energy consumption testing

Latency profilers for interfaces (graphical or not) response times
****

=== Formal
[%step]
* type system
* model-checking
* [BLUE]#*abstract interpretation*#
* theorem proving (automated)

[.notes]
****
* typage -> restrict possible range of programs
* model-checking -> exhaustive analysis of program possible states
* abstract interpretation -> analysis of a subset of possible states for program components
* theorem proving -> demonstration of program completeness and semantic of program components

Alonzo Church, Kurt Gödel et Alan Turing during the 30's demonstrate with the halting probleme and Rice theorem that program analysis is non deterministic

There is no method to predict for *every* program if it might run with mistakes without actually running it
****

=== Reviews
[%step]
* formal audit
* change review
* over-the-shoulder review
* pair programming
* [BLUE]#*automated review*#

[.notes]
****
formal audit -> efficient, but not practical
change review -> diff reviews, pull/merge request
over-the-shoulder -> informal reviews, usually on a developper computer
pair programming -> Developpement à deux sur la même machine
****

== Automated Code Review

=== Avantages
* Fast
* Exhaustive
* Precise

=== Limitations
* Don't understand developer intention
* Automating everything is impossible
* False positive / false negative

[.notes]
****
Fast -> incomparably short compared to human review
Exhaustive -> integral codebase can be reviewed everytime
Precise -> violations can be precisely pointed (codeline)
****

[%notitle]
=== Limitations - Example
[source, java]
--
public class MathUtils{
    public int divide(boolean entry){
        int x;
        if(entry){ x = 0; }
        else { x = 5; }
        return 10/x;
    }
}

== SonarQube Main Concepts

* Metric
* Measure
* Rule
* Issue

[.notes]
****
Metric -> Measure type, qualitative or quantitative

Measure -> Metric value for a file or project for a specific analysis

Rule -> Recommended standard or practice

Issue -> Rule violation for a specific analysis
****

=== Water Leak

=== Analysis
* Blame data import
* Static analysis of source code
* [Optional] Static analysis of compiled code

[.note]
****
Snapshot ->	All measures of one specific analysis
****

=== Issue types

* Bug
* Vulnerability
* Security Hotspot
* Code Smell   

[.notes]
****
Bug -> wrong or probably wrong code

Vulnerability -> code allowing hacker abuse

Security Hotspot -> all security related that can only be manually reviewed

Code Smell -> all the rest
****

=== Severity
What's the worst thing that could happen, and how likely will it happens ?
|===
|          | Probable                | Improbable
| Harmful  | [DARKRED]#*E* Blocking# | [RED]#*D* Critical#
| Harmless | [ORANGE]#*C* Major#     | [YELLOW]#*B* Minor#
| Other    | [BLUE]#Info#            | [GREEN]#*A*#
|===

== SonarQube Specific Concepts

* Quality Profile

[.notes]
****
Quality Profile -> Rule set to apply for analysis
****

=== SonarQube Specific Concepts

* Remediation Cost
* Technical Debt

[.notes]
****
Remediation Cost ->	Estimated time to fix Vulnerability and Reliability Issues.

Technical Debt ->	Estimated time to fix Maintainability Issues and Code Smells
****

=== Quality Gate
Is it Releasable ?

=== Short-lived branches

[graphviz, g1, svg]
----
digraph G {
    rankdir=LR;
    edge [color=white]
    node [color=white shape=point width=0.2]
    graph[color=white bgcolor=transparent fontcolor=white splines=ortho style=rounded]
            
    subgraph cluster_1 {
        label = "main branch"
        c0 -> c1 -> c2 -> c3 -> c4 -> c5
    }

    subgraph cluster_2 {
        label = "feature branch"
        c1 -> s1 -> c3
    }
}
----
* should live less than a few days
* should merge into a parent branch
* should be related to only one version

[.notes]
****
Pull/Merge request branches
Feture branches
Security fixes
****

=== Long-lived branches

        m2 -> c1 -> c2 -> c3
    }
}
----
* represent a divergent branch

[.notes]
****
Main/Trunk/Master branch
Release Branch

* peut exister pour suivre plusieurs versions de l'application
